Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join k8s.home.mtaylor.io:6443 --token fsy9pu.pqdna2s8qijbdc41 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2cb7efb412f69421b7e53c1ea271b93b9a78e8767bc665efe5ff2a943ca0dc58 \
        --control-plane --certificate-key 946f7b80781db0539260b396d33d6991f868044744f64005d545a822322e8727

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8s.home.mtaylor.io:6443 --token fsy9pu.pqdna2s8qijbdc41 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2cb7efb412f69421b7e53c1ea271b93b9a78e8767bc665efe5ff2a943ca0dc58
